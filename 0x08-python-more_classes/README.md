We will achieve this with the following practive problems:
0. Write an empty class Rectangle that defines a rectangle
1. Write a class Rectangle that defines a rectangle by: (based on 0-rectangle.py)
2. Write a class Rectangle that defines a rectangle by: (based on 1-rectangle.py)
3. Write a class Rectangle that defines a rectangle by: (based on 2-rectangle.py)
4. Write a class Rectangle that defines a rectangle by: (based on 3-rectangle.py)
5. Write a class Rectangle that defines a rectangle by: (based on 4-rectangle.py)
6. Write a class Rectangle that defines a rectangle by: (based on 5-rectangle.py)
7. Write a class Rectangle that defines a rectangle by: (based on 6-rectangle.py)
8. Write a class Rectangle that defines a rectangle by: (based on 7-rectangle.py)
9. Write a class Rectangle that defines a rectangle by: (based on 8-rectangle.py)
