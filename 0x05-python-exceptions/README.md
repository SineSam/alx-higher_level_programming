0x05. Python - Exceptions

The learning outcomes for today's project are:
What's the difference between errors and exceptions
What are exceptions and how to use them
When do we need to use exceptions
How to correctly handle an exception
What's the purpose of catching exceptions
How to raise a builtin exception
When do we need to implement a clean-up action after an exception

We will practice these concepts with the following exercises:
0. Write a function that prints x elements of a list
1. Write a function that prints an integer
2. Write a function that prints the first x elements of a list and only integers
3. Write a function that divides 2 integers and prints the result
4. Write a function that divides element by element 2 lists.
5. Write a function that raises a type exception
6. Write a function that raises a name exception with a message.
